  <h2>About the dev:</h2>

  <p>Garrett Brown is an aspiring coder currently enrolled with Epicodus. Garrett graduated in the class of 2016 from Reynolds High School, and initially had wanted to pursue a theatre arts degree, as he had realized he had a passion for it just before he graduated. He went to school at Clackamas Community College, Mt. Hood Community College, and South Puget Sound Community College for 4 years. After realizing he didn't have a particular aim for what he was actually going to do after school, he took interest in coding as his cousin had been a graduate of Epicodus and quickly made progress in the field. Garrett took this inspiration and enrolled himself in hopes of finally finding a calling. </p>
  <p>Garrett's current interests include video games, Dungeons and Dragons with his friends, drawing, playing guitar and bass, (Although he's been doing a bad job of actually picking them up lately.) with intentions of creating music. He also enjoys theatre arts and has acted in 7 shows on stage, as an extra in Documentary Now!, and even the webseries "Fallen Justice." He also acted in "Dinner Detective Portland", an improv-based murder-mystery company for 2 years. Some of his favorite bands include Sybreed, Periphery, Perturbator, Celldweller, and A Day to Remember, with metal being his favorite genre. He currently resides in Portland living with his awesome roommates, their cat, Bowie, and their dog, Forest.</p>
