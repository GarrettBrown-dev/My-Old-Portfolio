    <h2>About the dev</h2>
    <p>Garrett Brown is a Software Engineer who graduated from Epicodus and worked under Hubb as an Angular Development Intern. Garrett graduated in the class of 2016 from Reynolds High School, and initially wanted to pursue a theatre arts degree, 
      as he had realized he had a passion for it just before he graduated. He went to school at Clackamas Community College, Mt. Hood Community College, and
      South Puget Sound Community College for 4 years. After realizing he didn't have a particular aim for what he was
      actually going to do after school, he took interest in coding as his cousin had been a graduate of Epicodus and
      quickly made progress in the field. Garrett took this inspiration and enrolled himself in hopes of finally finding
      a calling, and so far, it has been an amazing journey. He graduated from Epicodus in March 2021 with a certification
      In web-design. He finds himself most interested in Front-End development, Game-Design and UI/UX Design, as the visual 
      aspects of software engineering provide him with a greater sense of accomplishment. He is currently looking for his first Software Engineering job and is also volunteering with Kona Connect, assisting with their WordPress site, and, after beta-testing, working on the front-end for Sophia, Kona Connect's domestic abuse help chat-bot!
      </p>
    <p>Garrett's current interests include video games, Dungeons and Dragons with his friends, drawing, playing guitar
      and bass, (Although he's been doing a bad job of actually picking them up lately.) with intentions of creating
      music. He also enjoys theatre arts and has acted in 7 shows on stage, as an extra in "Documentary Now!", and even
      the webseries "Fallen Justice." He also acted in "Dinner Detective Portland", an improv-based murder-mystery
      company for 2 years. Some of his favorite bands include Sybreed, Periphery, Perturbator, Celldweller, and A Day to
      Remember, with metal being his favorite genre. He currently resides in SE Portland, but is eager to relocate, as it has been a dream of his since he was 14! </p>

      <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dungeon_Darkly"> Dungeon_Darkly</a>
        <p>An MUD (Multi-User-Dungeon) Game created by me and 4 other Epicodus students for our first team week! I
          worked on the old-style computer terminal UI, enemies placed in rooms and their stats, and room descriptions!
          Created with: <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, Javascript, Canvas, Node.JS, and Git.</span></p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dungeon_Darkly_Unity">Dungeon_Darkly_Unity</a>
        <p>The new and improved version of Dungeon_Darkly based on the legendary Unity Engine! I assisted in the
          creation of the UI to get it to look like a simple screen and scroll as the JS version did! Created with:
          <span class="highlight">Unity Engine, C#, Git.</span>
        </p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/RpgCompendium">RPG Compendium</a></li>
      <p>A database intended for use alongside Dungeon_Darkly. With this, you can add items, monsters and more to the
        list of things encountered in-game. I styled this page, and helped with the connections to the MySql database.
        Created with: <span class="highlight">C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySql.</span>
      </p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/choose-your-own-adventure">A Day at Epicodus</a>
        <p>A lovely flowchart-esque site that shows the general day for an Epicodus student. This site was meant to be
          an exploration of React animations and styling capabilities, but ended up becoming a fun nod towards our time
          spent in class.
          Created with: <span class="highlight">Javascript, React, React Spring, CSS, HTML, jQuery, Node.JS, and
            Git.</span></p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Radiolaria">Radiolaria</a>
        <p>My capstone project for Epicodus. This project was an attempt at recreating "Hanenbow", a template for the
          sound-based Nintendo DS game, Electroplankton. It also includes several coding excercises from projects and
          technologies I had wanted to use for it. This project cemented in my mind what I wanted to do as a software
          developer, and that was make unique experiences for a person to enjoy through sound, animation, and gameplay!
          I fully intend to work on this project in my off time, creating the other templates in the original game, and
          furthering my skills in what I love! Created with: <span class="highlight">Javascript, Matter.js, Tone.js,
            Three.js, P5 Physics Editor, HTML, CSS, and Git.</span></p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/template-monster-arcade-feature">Arcade-Feature</a>
        <p>My assigned project for Hubb Software! This is an arcade feature for Hubb's existing event-planning software. I worked with a fellow intern, Harrison Strand, my mentor, Grant Eadie, the marketing department and their CEO Robert Norton to create this feature! The backend is Angular based, and allows the users to change the colors according to a company's desired color scheme via state variables that are connected to an event-config JSON file! This product was built over 10 weeks and has already been purchased by 2 companies! I assisted in creating Snake-Eater, and the arcade splash page!
           Created with: <span class="highlight">Angular, TypeScript, Javascript, P5 Physics Editor, Figma, CSS, HTML, and Git.</span></p>
