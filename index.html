    <h2>About the dev</h2>
    <p>Garrett Brown is an aspiring coder currently enrolled with Epicodus. Garrett graduated in the class of 2016 from
      Reynolds High School, and initially wanted to pursue a theatre arts degree, as he had realized he had a passion
      for it just before he graduated. He went to school at Clackamas Community College, Mt. Hood Community College, and
      South Puget Sound Community College for 4 years. After realizing he didn't have a particular aim for what he was
      actually going to do after school, he took interest in coding as his cousin had been a graduate of Epicodus and
      quickly made progress in the field. Garrett took this inspiration and enrolled himself in hopes of finally finding
      a calling. </p>
    <p>Garrett's current interests include video games, Dungeons and Dragons with his friends, drawing, playing guitar
      and bass, (Although he's been doing a bad job of actually picking them up lately.) with intentions of creating
      music. He also enjoys theatre arts and has acted in 7 shows on stage, as an extra in Documentary Now!, and even
      the webseries "Fallen Justice." He also acted in "Dinner Detective Portland", an improv-based murder-mystery
      company for 2 years. Some of his favorite bands include Sybreed, Periphery, Perturbator, Celldweller, and A Day to
      Remember, with metal being his favorite genre. He currently resides in Portland. </p>

      <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dungeon_Darkly"> Dungeon_Darkly</a>
        <p>An MUD (Multi-User-Dungeon) Game created by me and 4 other Epicodus students for our first team week! I
          worked on UI, enemy characters placed in rooms, and room descriptions! Created with: <span
            class="highlight">HTML, CSS, Javascript, Canvas, Node.JS, and Git.</span></p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dungeon_Darkly_Unity">Dungeon_Darkly_Unity</a>
        <p>The new and improved version of Dungeon_Darkly based on the legendary Unity Engine! I assisted in the
          creation of the UI to get it to look like a simple screen and scroll as the JS version did! Created with:
          <span class="highlight">Unity Engine, C#, Git.</span>
        </p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Galactic-Calculator-2">ASMR Bliss</a>
        <p>A website created for Javascript Team-Week at Epicodus. This site has two animated pages that create soothing
          sounds. One is slime themed, and allows you to click and drag for extra slimey sounds, and the other is a page
          with a simple Canvas rain animation and sounds of the rain. The other two pages include bios about all team
          members, and a link to a mukbang playlist! I created the rain animation on my own, and assisted with trial and
          error testing of several other aspects such as playing the background animations properly, refresh rate of the
          slime animation, and bio screen creation. Created with: <span class="highlight">Javascript, Canvas, CSS,
            HTML, jQuery, Node.JS, and Git.</span></p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/RpgCompendium">RPG Compendium</a>
        <p>A database intended for use alongside Dungeon_Darkly. With this, you can add items, monsters and more to the
          list of things encountered in-game. I styled this page, and helped with the connections to the MySql database.
          *Note: there is a more updated version of this, however I was not part of the team the week it was updated due
          to team assignments. Created with <span class="highlight">C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySql.</span></p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dr.SillyStringzSketchyFactoryII">Dr.SillyStringz Sketchy
          Factory</a>
        <p>A project based in C# showcasing my knowledge of many-to-many relationships. I'm proud of this one due to the
          lovely styling I implemented here. Created with: <span class="highlight">C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
            MySql.</span></p>
