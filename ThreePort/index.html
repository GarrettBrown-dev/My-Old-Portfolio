        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>Garrett Brown is a Software Engineer who graduated from Epicodus and worked under Hubb as an Angular Development Intern. Garrett graduated in the class of 2016 from Reynolds High School, and initially wanted to pursue a theatre arts degree, 
          as he had realized he had a passion for it just before he graduated. He went to school at Clackamas Community College, Mt. Hood Community College, and
          South Puget Sound Community College for 4 years. After realizing he didn't have a particular aim for what he was
          actually going to do after school, he took interest in coding as his cousin had been a graduate of Epicodus and
          quickly made progress in the field. Garrett took this inspiration and enrolled himself in hopes of finally finding
          a calling, and so far, it has been an amazing journey. He graduated from Epicodus in March 2021 with a certification
          In web-design. He finds himself most interested in Front-End development, Game-Design and UI/UX Design, as the visual 
          aspects of software engineering provide him with a greater sense of accomplishment. He is currently looking for his first Software Engineering job and is also volunteering with Kona Connect, assisting with their WordPress site, and, after beta-testing, working on the front-end for Sophia, Kona Connect's domestic abuse help chat-bot!
          </p>
        <p>Garrett's current interests include video games, Dungeons and Dragons with his friends, drawing, playing guitar
          and bass, (Although he's been doing a bad job of actually picking them up lately.) with intentions of creating
          music. He also enjoys theatre arts and has acted in 7 shows on stage, as an extra in "Documentary Now!", and even
          the webseries "Fallen Justice." He also acted in "Dinner Detective Portland", an improv-based murder-mystery
          company for 2 years. Some of his favorite bands include Sybreed, Periphery, Perturbator, Celldweller, and A Day to
          Remember, with metal being his favorite genre. He currently resides in SE Portland, but is eager to relocate, as it has been a dream of his since he was 14! </p>
